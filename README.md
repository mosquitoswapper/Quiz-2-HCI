After applying the Principles:
- resizing the dimension into 1440 x 2010 ( So it could fit the screen and making it consistent with the othe later)
- Added a Homepage as a dummy to showcase the navigation patterns ( In the navbar)
- For the layout and structure added the breakpoints in different media
After designing:

Part 2 : Implementation of the design
Navigation:
before I already implemented the navbar, however I still havent implemented the functionality such as navigating to the differnet page and for the after i've implemented by putting a dummy home page which is is the homepage to showcase if the navigation really works or not

Input and forms & data presentation
For the input I dont change anything because i think the input functionalities already like for the name I use the input type text and for the party size and VIP room I use option I think its suitable because it restrict the user from typing unnecessary input and to make the data overal consistent (data presentation involved). Additionally, I've also implemented the time and month and for that I also uses the input type date and time to again present the data from user much more consistent (data presentation)

I've also implemented an inline implementation which shows eror, the purpose is to make the data much more consistent in the end and to restrict user to enter unwanted data

Feedback and status
I've already implemented this after the user already fill all the forms and user click submit it will inform the user that the data is already submitted, I think it fits my fetaure because it is forms mainly and user need an output so that they know if the reservation form has been sucsessfully sent or not

Layout and structure
I've already implemented the card design before and it is used to make it much more tidy the card layput is not really mainly used on the form but I used it to present the restaurant image and below it is the restaurant name because I think it improves thes overall aesthetics and make it much more organized
